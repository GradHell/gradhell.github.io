								<h2>Games Vs Narrative (Do games tell stories?)<br />
								</h2>
							</header>
							<p>Narrative and gameplay are arguably the two most prominent forms of expression that can be found in a modern video game. But before we wade into the deep end of the pool, let's get precise about what we mean by narrative and gameplay respectively.

								Gameplay is relatively simple to define for our purposes. Any action in the game that is occurs by way of interaction between the player and the game, we call gameplay.
								
								Generically speaking, a narrative is just the description of a series of events. At its most atomic level, virtually any visual component of a game can carry a sort of narrative with it, telling you something about its context and history.
								
								When we normally talk about narrative in the context of games, we mean things like cutscenes, plots, relationships between characters, and stories that are expressed continuously through the course of a game.
								
								However, a scene of two characters arguing about where to go next is as valid a narrative as simply looking at a graphic of a bright blood-stained and nicked sword.
								
								The main difference is one of complexity and sophistication. In the latter example, the narrative is expressed as a single visual: I see a sword, it has recently drawn blood, it has struck a very hard object. In the former example, the narrative is communicated via visuals, like setting and choice of dress, but also via actor performance, which includes all kinds of details like gesticulation, subtle body language, voice, and so on.
								
								There's an important implication here -- if a game has any discernable graphics at all, there is always some sort of story, or narrative, being told to you (or at least being interpreted by you) as you play. Indeed, humans are really good at constructing narratives about what happened to that bloody, nicked sword, even if one wasn't offered or intended. Even pure action/zero story games cannot be wholly divorced from narrative, because the player will always extract meaning, and thereby a story, from graphics.
								
								The point is that there exist very different levels and techniques of narrative expression, and each comes with its corresponding set of prerequisites that must be satisfied before the player (or viewer) is able to apprehend a game's narrative.</p>

							<h3>What do you expect from different media, such as newspapers, books, music, television, and film?</h3>
							<p>Other than playing video games, I spent most of my time watching movies or watching television shows. 
								But I will compare media like films with video games. The general difference is between movies and video 
								games are, video games are all about player experience and interaction. One of the differences between 
								movies and video games is pacing. Films moves along with its own speed regardless the audience have to 
								do something else. However, the video games are unique storytelling medium where the player or the 
								user can control the pace of the story. Another difference between video games and films are exploration. 
								The world building in the movies are amazing, but it also confines of its own story. But in video games, 
								the players can pick up the tiniest detail by exploring the world created in the game. Another difference 
								between films and video games are oblique storytelling. Narrative is the key content for both media. 
								However, video games don’t have any limitations how it’s going to present its own story. A film must find 
								a balance between action and dialogue. Video game on the other hand doesn’t require any rigid obligation 
								to keep things balanced</p>

							<h3>What is your perception of video game violence?</h3>
							<p>My perception of violence in video games is that it makes, and individual become more aware of their 
								environment. There is always some sort of tasks in violent video games that requires to complete specific 
								missions as part of the goal. Their ability to find items that are challenging is about 30% higher than it is 
								for someone who does not play games regularly. The accuracy rate is also 50 percentage points higher for 
								someone who is a regular gamer compared to one who is not. This trait makes it possible for individuals 
								to locate potential threats in real-life environments with greater speed and accuracy when compared to 
								someone who doesn’t play video games.</p>

							<h3>Does your online (video game) life affect your offline life? If yes, how? If not, why?</h3>
							<p>My online (gaming) life sometimes affect my offline. When I play online games like League of legends or 
								Valorant, these game takes a lot of time and it’s really hard to keep track of time while playing these 
								games</p>
